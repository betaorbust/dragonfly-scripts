# Dragonfly Scripts

This is a collection of personal dragonfly sripts, primarily set up to let me code following an injury. It was originally based on the fantastic [dragonfly-scripts](https://github.com/dictation-toolbox/dragonfly-scripts).

Unfortunately, voice coding is brutally wheel-reinventy at the moment, so your mileage may vary with this code.
